# Ratter Scanner CDN
This is the CDN that will be used for Ratter Scanner's file storing.
This project is a rewrite of our existing CDN.

This is also a test project, and allows our team to get more insight in how we would like to do a recode of our other services.

# How to test / run
To be added.

# CI/CD pipeline
To be added.
Merge's or commits should trigger an update of the currently used CDN.
This will probably be managed by another internal service, also written in c#.
